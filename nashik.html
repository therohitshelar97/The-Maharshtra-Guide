                <h2>History Of Nashik</h2>
                <p>
                    Nashik was known by different names in different Yugas. According to Hindu legends, It was known as "Padmanagar" during Satya Yuga, "Trikantak" during Treta Yuga, "Janasthana" during Dvapara Yuga, and ultimately "Navashikh" or "Nashik" during Kali Yuga. During the Mughal period it was known as "Gulshanabad", the city of roses. Nashik has mythological, historical, social and cultural importance. The city is situated on the banks of the Godavari River, making it one of the holiest places for Hindus all over the world. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Rama, the King of Ayodhya, made Nashik his abode during his 14 years in exile. At the same place Lord Laxman, by the wish of Lord Rama, cut the nose of "Shurpanakha" and thus this city was named as "Nasik" as the word Nasik means nose in Sanskrit.

                    After the fall of the Satavahana empire, the Abhiras or Ahirs ruled in the north east and the Chutus in Maharashtra and Kuntala. The Puranas state that ten Abhira tribes ruled for 67 years. The Nashik inscription speaks of king Madhuriputra Ishvarasena, the Abhir and a son of Shivadatla. This dynasty originated in 249–250 CE, an era called Kalachuri or Chedi in later times.[1]

                    Classical Sanskrit poets like Valmiki, Kālidāsa and Bhavabhuti have paid rich tributes here. In 150 BCE Nashik was the country's largest market place. From 1487 CE, the province came under the rule of Mughals and its name was changed Gulshanabad (No such proofs for this name). It was also home of Emperor Akbar who wrote at length about Nashik in Ein-e-Akbari. It was also known as the 'Land of the Brave' during the regime of Maratha Emperor Shivaji.

                    The most important historical significance is that Kumbh Mela is conducted at Nashik once every twelve years, out of 4 places in India.

                <h2>Panchavati</h2>
                <p>
                    When Lord Rama and Lady Sita were asked to leave Ayodhya by beloved Step-Mother Kaikeyi under the influenced of Manthara her maid, the two left. However, compelled by the love for his elder brother, Lakshman also left with the couple on exile for 14 years. Panchavati was the place where the trio made their home while serving the exile, the word literally meaning 'garden of five banyan trees'. The trees could still be seen in the temple premises nearby Sita Gufaa. With Godavari flowing nearby, even the scary forests with roving animals became heavenly sanctity.
